# Cuphead Boss Roulette - Project Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-30
Current local version: 0.5.25

This file is the working context for the next agent. Read it before changing the
mod. The user has iterated on the layout by eye, so preserve all explicit
coordinates and avoid broad rewrites.

## Goal

Convert the boss roulette from the user's website into a BepInEx mod for
Cuphead. The roulette runs inside the game, chooses a boss/loadout/challenge,
equips the result, and loads the selected fight.

The target is not a generic mod UI. It must closely resemble Cuphead's original
Equip Card in layout, typography, input, animation, sound, and native prompts.

## Current Git state

The working tree is intentionally dirty and contains the current development
work. Do not reset, restore, or overwrite it. At the time of this handoff:

- Modified: `CupheadBossRoulette.csproj`
- Modified: `EquipCardLayout.cs`
- Modified: `Plugin.cs`
- Modified: `RouletteData.cs`
- Untracked: `NativeMapPrompt.cs`
- Untracked: `assets/card/roulette-card.png`
- Untracked WAV files under `assets/sounds`

No commit or push was requested for these changes.

## Build and install

No package installation is needed. Existing references point to the local game.

```powershell
dotnet build .\CupheadBossRoulette.csproj -c Release --no-restore
```

Output:

`bin\Release\net35\Gilomx.CupheadBossRoulette.dll`

To test, close Cuphead, replace only the installed DLL, and restart Cuphead.
Keep the `assets` directory beside the DLL. Verify the version and errors in
`BepInEx\LogOutput.log`.

## User-facing behavior

- The roulette can only open after loading a save and while freely walking on a
  map.
- It must not open at the title screen or inside a fight.
- `F6` opens/closes the roulette.
- Arrow keys move/change options.
- `Enter` selects.
- `Esc` closes the roulette without also opening Cuphead's pause menu.
- The mouse is not required.
- Forced selection from the website is intentionally excluded.
- The normal Equip Card must continue to open with `Shift` whenever the
  roulette is closed.
- While the roulette is open, native Equip Card input is temporarily disabled.
  Restore it on the next frame when the roulette closes.

## Roulette options and flow

Settings are persisted through BepInEx config:

- Difficulty: Simple / Normal / Expert
- Challenge (label is `RETO`, previously `MODO FEO`)
- Automatic load

If a setting changes after a completed spin, invalidate the old result and put
the main action back to `GIRAR`.

When automatic load is disabled:

- After a spin, the main action becomes `JUGAR`.
- `Enter` on `JUGAR` loads the result.
- `F7` shows a native `VOLVER A GIRAR` prompt and allows another spin.

Airplane bosses still roll and equip weapon A, weapon B, super, and charm.
Those ground loadout values do not affect airplane weapons, but leaving all
slots populated looks better and is the behavior requested by the user.

## Challenge lifecycle

Challenge names currently come from `RouletteData.Modifiers`.

Required behavior:

- Show `RETO: <name>` only during the exact fight loaded by the roulette.
- Do not show anything for `Nada`.
- A loss and retry keep the challenge.
- Winning clears it immediately.
- Leaving the level and returning to the map clears it.
- Entering another level clears a stale challenge.

Implementation:

- `Plugin.cs` stores `activeChallenge` and `activeChallengeBoss`.
- A Harmony prefix on `Level._OnPreWin` clears the challenge on victory.
- Map/different-level detection clears abandoned state.
- `NativeMapPrompt.cs` clones the already-working native map prompt before the
  map scene unloads. It places the clone on a persistent Screen Space Overlay
  canvas, hides the key capsule, and displays the same native text styling in
  the bottom-right corner through retries.

Version 0.5.24 tried to find the map prompt again after entering the battle.
That failed because the map canvas had already been destroyed. Version 0.5.25
uses the persistent clone described above.

Manual end-to-end checks still recommended:

1. Spin with RETO enabled until a non-`Nada` challenge is selected.
2. Confirm the bottom-right label appears in the fight.
3. Lose and retry; confirm it remains.
4. Quit to map; confirm it disappears and F6 prompt returns.
5. Win; confirm it disappears before/at the victory flow.

## Native prompts and overlay

`NativeMapPrompt.cs` clones Cuphead's PauseGUI help prompt. It is used for:

- `ABRIR RULETA` + F6 on the map
- `VOLVER A GIRAR` + F7 when applicable
- The persistent informational challenge prompt during a fight

The F6/F7 capsule dimensions and text offset were tuned by the user. Preserve:

- Minimum key width: 30
- Key padding: 2.5
- Key text anchored offset: `(-10, -0.3)`
- Right edge constant: 1290
- Text-to-key gap: 4.5

The roulette dim layer must be behind the card and the native F7 prompt must be
in front of it.

## Card layout invariants

These values were adjusted repeatedly by the user and are considered final:

- Shot A center: `(98.4, 399)`
- Shot B center: `(199.1, 399)`
- Super center: `(298.9, 399)`
- Charm center: `(397.7, 399)`
- Challenge center: `(497.1, 399)`

They are defined near the top of `EquipCardLayout.cs`. Do not change them
unless the user explicitly requests it.

The card background is:

`assets/card/roulette-card.png`

It was exported from the supplied PSD and includes the boss portrait circle.
Do not move other content when replacing the background.

## Native game assets

Weapon, super, charm, empty-slot, sheen, and cursor sprites are resolved from
Cuphead resources through `GameTheme`.

Selected equipment icons use three-frame animations. The original Equip Card
was measured live at about one frame every 0.08 seconds, or 12.5 FPS. The mod
uses `EquipIconFramesPerSecond = 12.5f`.

Do not change sheen/cursor speed when changing equipment icon speed; they are
separate animations.

Boss portraits and challenge artwork come from the user's web assets.

## Audio

Runtime audio uses WAV files because Unity 2017 reliably loads those in this
environment:

- `assets/sounds/spin.wav`
- `assets/sounds/selection.wav`
- `assets/sounds/abrir.wav`
- `assets/sounds/cerrar.wav`

These are decoded versions of the website audio. The original MP3 files may
also exist in the installed asset folder.

Spin audio and one-shot effects use separate `AudioSource` objects. This is
important: using one source caused the final stop sound to be cut off when the
looping spin audio stopped.

## Source file responsibilities

- `Plugin.cs`
  - BepInEx entry point
  - config and input
  - roulette state machine
  - loadout application and level loading
  - challenge state/lifecycle
  - sound loading
- `EquipCardLayout.cs`
  - current Equip Card-style roulette rendering
  - exact positions and native icon animation
- `NativeMapPrompt.cs`
  - native F6/F7 labels
  - dim overlay
  - persistent fight challenge label
- `RouletteData.cs`
  - bosses, weapons, supers, charms, modifiers
  - native sprite names and asset paths
- `GameTheme.cs`
  - fonts, native sprite lookup, paper/theme helpers

`DrawRouletteLegacy` still exists in `Plugin.cs` but is not the active card
renderer. Avoid editing it unless deliberately removing legacy code.

## Previous regressions to avoid

- Do not globally consume or disable Shift. It broke the original Equip Card.
- Do not leave `MapEquipUI` disabled after the roulette closes.
- Do not let Esc close the roulette and also open the pause menu.
- Do not open the roulette automatically when Cuphead starts.
- Do not show F6 outside the map.
- Do not clear the active challenge on defeat; retry must retain it.
- Do not show a challenge on the map after victory/exit.
- Do not modify the five finalized equipment coordinates casually.
- Preserve UTF-8 source encoding; earlier mojibake produced broken accents.

## Design preferences from the user

- Faithful Cuphead presentation is more important than a generic modern UI.
- Prefer actual game fonts, sprites, prompts, sounds, and animations.
- No large custom rectangles when native labels can be reused.
- Keyboard-only navigation should feel like the Equip Card.
- The card should enter/exit like Cuphead's card and should not use a heavy
  custom drop shadow.
- The boss image is smaller than Cuphead/Mugman on the original Equip Card.
- Boss and level names should use game localization where possible.
- Challenge restrictions are informational; they do not need to enforce input.

## Verification status at handoff

- Version 0.5.25 builds with `dotnet build -c Release --no-restore`.
- Expected baseline is zero errors and zero warnings.
- BepInEx should report exactly one plugin:
  `Gilomx Boss Roulette 0.5.25`.
- The persistent challenge label requires the manual five-step gameplay test
  listed above.
